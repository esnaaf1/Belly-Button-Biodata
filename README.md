# BELLY-BUTTON-BIODATA

In this project, I have built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.  The dataset catalogs microbes that colonize human navels.

The project uses Javascript and D3. 
It contains the following dashboards for each subject in the dataset: A bar graph showing the top ten microbes, a gauge showing the belly button washing frequency per week; and bacteria culture per sample.
