# BELLY-BUTTON-BIODATA

In this project, I have built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.  The dataset catalogs microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The project uses Javascript D3 and Plotly.

It contains the following dashboards for each subject in the dataset: 

1. A bar graph showing the top ten microbes
2. A gauge-style visual showing the belly button washing frequency per week
3. A bubble chart showing bacteria culture per sample.  

To see the visualization, please open index.html on the local server, or with Lives Server in visual studio code, for example.
